hacking definition: breaking into or intervening into a system and changing or destroying it from the inside out.
--> violence, invasion
-> technopolitics, deconstruction, implementation, vulnerability, interrelationships, philosophy, strategy.

 "the greater the dependence on (a) technology, 
 the greater the need to study and expose its inner workings
 regardless of ownership or legal provision"
------> showing vulnerability of public to mass surveillance

       affordances; all the things you can do with an object 
-an affordance points both ways, to the environment and to the observer-
  —> james gibson 

‘design of everyday things’: all the things you perceive you can do with an object 
  —> dan norman

interfaces; ‘in between surfaces’, communication/connection
 the common boundary of (media) people and (media) apparatus is one example of what we call an interface
 based on a world of at least a duality
 —> galloway, interface action

interface as action
-language
-body
-technical/cultural
—> media vs. interface / marshall mcluhan vs a gallowa

inspection tool: pair of yellow scissors
 contrast sharp+hard vs. warm+soft
 but also contrast in professional vs. informal (a child could use it, but also a business man)
 sounds like a typical scissor: mmmmmtsjak 
 methods of observation: touch, smell, seeing, use, sounds

article: Choreographic Object by William Forsythe

choreography -> dynamic constellations, conscious or not, aesthetic practice, patterns in nature, 
 first a documentation tool, later became a prescription/definition/interaction
   -> zoom in+out: handlevel, body level, world level

etymology: writing movement: dance + writing = xoros + yraphia (greek)
 chora= space
 choreo= to give room, to make space
 [making public = confined yet open space]
    score: cut in woord } etym.
    scar: cut in skin?  } etym.
    
-choreography explores physicality of the body-
 flesh: physicalized relational field of interaction, intensities, techniques
invert choreography
-> scripted movement

choreography: 
 *structuur die relaties binnen systemen+objecten vernieuwt
 *wil actie, verandering, ideeën, failure
 *valt niet te vangen in een definitie, is te breed
 
programming:
 -EWMN: Eshkol-Wachman Movement Notation
 -labnotation

Examples of Choreography Mapping
 -society: 
   wetboek
 -human <> non human programming:
   tutorials, ikea manual
 -natural agency:
   stamboom (family tree)
 -human <> computer programming/society
   instagram algoritme
 -human <> human programming


--hacking gestures--
 humans are so used to routinely following gestures (eg: clicking a certain button on your phone will lower the volume).
 if you hack this system by changing up the placement of the buttons, confusion will arise.
 
Anatomy of Connectology
zuignap
use: to hang things on a flat surface, to make things seem vague when looking through, as a screw, to fidget
how: licking improves the function, put it on a clean, flat surface
material: plastic with metal
reshaped and bent
transparant and grey

@Varia, Florian Cramer

what is hacking?
 -> breaking into systems with unwritten rules

hacking-hakken (chopping) 
 e.g. fixing a table (stabilizing) in a different way then it is supposed to be fixed, is not real carpenting
lifehack = shortcut

hacking ltd: not having your usual toolkits. for this you first need to define your toolkits

origin of hacking:
TMRC (Tech Model Railroad Club) @ MIT, 1946
-> original hacker culture: 'playing' with things
ex: lockpicking -> mechanical hacking

look into: superuse studios -> poortgebouw -> worm/wunderbar (squatting community)

 *playing with systems
 *open access (sharing knowledge)
 *jargon/'hacker-slang' (d-dos attack)

look into: open design now (book), same mindset as dave hakkens (design academy eindhoven, precious plastic)

+ john draper - cap'n' crunch
 -> flute, free phone calls -> blue boxes, steve jobs
 -> YIPL (youth international party line
 
+ abbie hoffman - steal this book
 -> counterculture, living off the grid, 1960s (link hacking-counterculture)
 
+ 2600 -  hacker zine 
+ xs4all
+ yes men
-> fake news, WTO

+ cornelia sollfrank
-> intervention @ chaos computer club, contraception compute
  -> putting an object in a different situation/space then where it belongs
  
+ piratenpartij, pirate bay
-> piraterij is een misdrijf

+ black head hacker vs white head hacker
-> why can't there be such a thing as a grey head hacker?
